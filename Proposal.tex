\section{Description}
In ``Fruits of Your Labor,'' the user is the owner a virtual plant.  The plant will be an animated sprite on the screen drawn in pixel art.  There will be many different graphical elements that can become part of the user's plant, so that each user's plant is unique, visually.
\\Like a real plant, the plant requires care to live and flourish.  The plant can be given fertilizer, water, sunshine, and social interactions.  Some of these actions are done simply via buttons in the GUI, while others are done via real life social activity, such as being in sunny weather, being near someone else running the app, or connecting with social media sites.

\section{Features}
Going near a grocery store gives the user 3 fertilizers.  They can be used at any time.
\\Being in a location that has sunny weather causes the plant to ``grow.''  In what way is not yet certain.
\\Doing any beneficial action while near another user doubles the action's effect.
\\Posting to Twitter from within Fruits of Your Labor causes your plant to ``grow.''
