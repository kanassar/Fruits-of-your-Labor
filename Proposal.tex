\section{Description}
In ``Fruits of Your Labor,'' the user is the owner a virtual pet.  The pet will be an animated sprite on the screen drawn in pixel art.  There will be many different graphical elements that can become part of the user's pet, so that each user's pet is unique, visually.
\\Like a real pet, the pet requires care to live and flourish.  The pet can be given food/fertilizer, water, sunshine, and social interactions.  Some of these actions are done simply via buttons in the GUI, while others are done via real life social activity, such as being in sunny weather, being near someone else running the app, or connecting with social media sites.

\section{Features}
Going near a grocery store gives the user 3 food items/fertilizers.  They can be used at any time.
\\Being in a location that has sunny weather causes the pet to ``grow.''  In what way is not yet certain.
\\Doing any beneficial action while near another user doubles the action's effect.
\\Posting to a social network from within Fruits of Your Labor causes your pet to ``grow.''
